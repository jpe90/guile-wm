This is an experimental fork of Mark Whitmer's [guile-wm](https://github.com/mwitmer/guile-wm). I'm new to guile and wanted to try to get a tiling window w/ functionality similar to StumpWM up and running.

I found this project which didn't immediately work on my machine, so I updated it and its dependency [guile-xcb](https://github.com/mwitmer/guile-xcb) to build on my machine with guile 3. It currently builds (for me) and I'm using it as a daily driver.

# building

building works the same as the original project, but it needs updates from my fork of guile-xcb available here: https://github.com/jpe90/guile-xcb

# current goals

i'm working to address outstanding issues in this repository's issue tracker
