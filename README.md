# Abandoned

I've stopped working on this since I hopped off GUIX, but I'm leaving the respository on the off chance that it's helpful to anyone.

I found this project which didn't immediately work on my machine, so I updated it and its dependency [guile-xcb](https://github.com/mwitmer/guile-xcb) to build on my machine with guile 3.

# building

building works the same as the original project, but it needs updates from my fork of guile-xcb available here: https://github.com/jpe90/guile-xcb
